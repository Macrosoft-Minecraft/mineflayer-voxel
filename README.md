# mineflayer-voxel

Attempt at visualizing what the bot is up to using voxel.js

### Roadmap

 * Integrate properly with terrain generation system of voxel.js
 * Send lots of terrain initially
 * Display mobs
 * Allow bot to highlight data

### Precondition

You must extract textures from minecraft.jar (Note, must be snapshot, not the current release!).

`node extract_textures.js <path_to_minecraft.jar>`

### Usage

`npm start`
